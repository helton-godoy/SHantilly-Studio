# Data Flow & Integrations

Explain how data enters, moves through, and exits the system, including interactions with external services.

## Module Dependencies

- _No cross-module dependencies detected._

## Service Layer

- _No service classes detected._

## High-level Flow

Summarize the primary pipeline from input to output. Reference diagrams or embed Mermaid definitions when available.

## Internal Movement

Describe how modules within `AGENT_GUIDE.md`, `build-pkg`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `conductor`, `core.1`, `docs`, `GEMINI.md`, `packaging`, `README.md`, `scripts`, `src`, `tests` collaborate (queues, events, RPC calls, shared databases).

## External Integrations

Document each integration with purpose, authentication, payload shapes, and retry strategy.

## Observability & Failure Modes

Describe metrics, traces, or logs that monitor the flow. Note backoff, dead-letter, or compensating actions when downstream systems fail.
